# Maintenance status

Unmaintained, maintainers needed! I just took the archived repository, and released it to the Terraform Registry. I'm not a Go developer, so I'll not be able to maintain this repository in the long run. PRs are welcome, and I'll try to merge and release them as frequently as possible.

If you would like Atlassian to take ownership of the provider, you can voice your opinion at [BCLOUD-17209](https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/BCLOUD-17209).

## History

- Initally created during an Atlassian [24h hackathon](https://www.atlassian.com/company/shipit) by @cwood
- Maintained by HashiCorp and @cwood with contributions from the community
- [Archived](https://www.terraform.io/docs/internals/archiving.html) by HashiCorp due not being maintained (likely related to not being published to the registry)
- Forked and published to [Terraform Registry](https://registry.terraform.io) by @aeirola

Requirements
------------

-	[Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html) 0.12.x
-	[Go](https://golang.org/doc/install) 1.11 (to build the provider plugin)

Building The Provider
---------------------

Clone repository to: `$GOPATH/src/github.com/terraform-providers/terraform-provider-bitbucket`

```sh
$ mkdir -p $GOPATH/src/github.com/terraform-providers; cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/terraform-providers
$ git clone git@github.com:terraform-providers/terraform-provider-bitbucket
```

Enter the provider directory and build the provider

```sh
$ cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/terraform-providers/terraform-provider-bitbucket
$ make build
```

Using the provider
----------------------

```hcl
# Configure the Bitbucket Provider
provider "bitbucket" {
  username = "GobBluthe"
  password = "idoillusions" # you can also use app passwords
}

# Manage your repository
resource "bitbucket_repository" "infrastructure" {
  owner = "myteam"
  name  = "terraform-code"
}

# Manage your project
resource "bitbucket_project" "infrastructure" {
  owner = "myteam" # must be a team
  name  = "terraform-project"
  key   = "TERRAFORMPROJ"
}
```

Developing the Provider
---------------------------

If you wish to work on the provider, you'll first need [Go](http://www.golang.org) installed on your machine (version 1.11+ is *required*). You'll also need to correctly setup a [GOPATH](http://golang.org/doc/code.html#GOPATH), as well as adding `$GOPATH/bin` to your `$PATH`.

To compile the provider, run `make build`. This will build the provider and put the provider binary in the `$GOPATH/bin` directory.

```sh
$ make build
...
$ $GOPATH/bin/terraform-provider-bitbucket
...
```

In order to test the provider, you can simply run `make test`.

```sh
$ make test
```

In order to run the full suite of Acceptance tests, run `make testacc`.

*Note:* Terraform needs TF_ACC env variable set to run acceptance tests

*Note:* Acceptance tests create real resources, and often cost money to run.

```sh
$ make testacc
```

About V1 APIs
------------------

This provider will not take any PRs about the v1 apis that dont have v2
equivalents. Please only focus on v2 apis when adding new featues to this
provider.
